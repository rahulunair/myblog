# Flashcard Rust: First steps

Rust is one of the coolest systems programming lanugage on the block, let's dip our feet in it.

## Setup

Hopefully, you are using Linux. To install Rust, use:

```python
> curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Rustup is a tool that is used to install Rust, the above script downloads and installs `rustup` first and then installs Rust.


## Ahoy!

Let's create a directory to keep our source files:

```python
> mkdir ~/rust_sources
> cd ~/rust_sources
```

Our first program, to say `ahoy!`


```python
> mkdir ahoy; cd ahoy
> touch main.rs
```

Open `main.rs` and add the following line:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("ahoy ahoy!");  
}
```

Save the file and run `rustc main.rs`, thats it! We have compiled our first rust program.

There should be a file named `main` in the same directory main.rs is in, execute it using:

```python
./main
ahoy ahoy!
```

Now that you have written 2 lines of rust, do [read](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html)
