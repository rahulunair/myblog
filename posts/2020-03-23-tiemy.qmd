# Timing python functions

I have been writing some performant code in Python (oxymoron?), and I wanted a simple decorator to time funtions essentially to measure running time.

There a plenty of modules in Python that can help with this, but most were complicated for me to understand what exactly they were doing and had way more functionaltiy than I required.

So I wrote a tiny package that can help with this. The package is named `tiemy` and is available in pypi, it only has one single decorator, `timer` and I would like to keep it to a minimum.

You just have to use the decorator 
`@timer` on any Python callable and tiemy runs the function for 3 times and displays the mean and standard deviation of the run time. 

At the core tiemy uses `perf_counter` from [time module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter) to measure running time.


## Installing tiemy

The module is fairly easy to install, you just need python and pip:

```python
pip install tiemy
```

That's it!

## How to use tiemy

Consider a prime number sieve as below is saved in a file `prime.py`

```python
from tiemy import timer

@timer
def sundaram(N):
	"""sundaram's sieve to find non primes."""
    primes = list(range(3, N, 2))
    half = N // 2
    init = 4
    for step in range(3, N, 2):
        for i in range(init, half, step):
            primes[i-1] = 0
        init += 2 * (step + 1)
        if init > half:
            return [2] + list(filter(0, numbers))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sundaram(100000)
```

The output would be something like:

```python
python prime.py
timing func:: sundaram
mean:     0.0090, std:     0.0003 sec.
```

The above method to find prime numbers is called sundaram sieve [^1], we will look at it more in detail in a later post :).

## The end

[Tiemy](https://pypi.org/project/tiemy/), pronunced as `tie-mee`, is a simple timing decorator that just does one thing, measure running time.
