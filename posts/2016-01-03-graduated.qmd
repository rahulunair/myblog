# Graduated

Finally, after two years of going to school, late-night working on projects when dinner meant calling Dominos at 2:00 AM, I have graduated with a Masters in Computer Engineering. The final semester had been very kind to me; I had a lot of opportunities to work with some cool folks on different aspects of the cloud and Machine Learning.

Till a month back I had deadlines and submissions, now I am relatively free, I know I should enjoy this moment but it is really hard to focus when you don't have anything much to do.
